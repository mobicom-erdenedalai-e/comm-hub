# CommHub Changelog

## PR Review Fixes (2026-04-27)

- **Build fix:** renamed `next.config.ts` → `next.config.mjs` (Next.js 14 does not support `.ts` config)
- **Ownership check:** `POST /api/generate` now uses `findFirst({ where: { id, userId } })` — prevents cross-user data access
- **JQL injection guard:** Jira connector validates `projectKey` against `/^[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{1,9}$/` and quotes it in JQL
- **Type safety:** added `src/types/next-auth.d.ts` module augmentation; removed `session.user as any` cast
- **Error handling:** `req.json()` in generate route wrapped in try/catch (400 on malformed body)
- **Settings page:** save() now surfaces network and API errors to the user
- **Env validation:** added `src/lib/env.ts` — validated getters replace `process.env.X!` non-null assertions

## Task 20: Full Test Suite & Coverage Check (2026-04-27)
- All 36 unit tests passing

## Task 19: Artifact History Click-Through (2026-04-27)

## Task 12: Clients CRUD & Artifacts API (2026-04-27)
- Added `app/api/clients/route.ts` — GET (list) + POST (create with integrations)
- Added `app/api/clients/[id]/route.ts` — PUT (update + replace integrations) + DELETE
- Added `app/api/artifacts/route.ts` — GET with `?clientId=` param, returns last 20
- All routes auth-guarded; ownership verified before mutations
